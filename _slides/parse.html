# Parse Tree 

--- 
# Language parsing

now you have a list of tokens 
depending on where the tokens are the meaning(=evaluated result) changes

```sh
(1+2)*3 
1+(2*3)
```

We build a parse tree - leaves are operands and non-leaf nodes are operators
---
# Tree

A tree is a data structure where 

	1) there is only one root node

	2) a parent node may have pointers to child nodes

	3) a node without child nodes is a leaf node

	4) there is only one path from any leaf to root node

# Parse tree node 

In lab06, we use `struct parse_node_st`

```c
struct parse_node_st {
    enum parse_expr_enum type;
    union {
        struct {
            int value;
        } intval;
        struct {
            enum parse_oper_enum oper;
            struct parse_node_st *operand;
        } oper1;
        struct {
            enum parse_oper_enum oper;
            struct parse_node_st *left;
            struct parse_node_st *right;
        } oper2;
    };                
};
```
