# C For Python/Java Programmers
---
## Some Similarities

Python
```python
def main:
    print('hello world')
    
if __name__ == 'main':
	main()
```
Java
```java
public static void main(String[] argv) {
    System.out.println("hello world"); 
}
```
C
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	printf("hello world\n");
	return 0;
}
```
___
- All are _imperative_ languages, like Algol, Pascal

- All have functions with variables and control flow
---
# Syntax Differences 
(not comprehensive)
---
## Statements
Python
```python
i = 1
j = 2
```
Java & C
```c
i = 1;
j = 2;
```
___
- In Python, newlines separate statements

- In Java and C, semicolons terminate statements
---
## Comments
Python
```python
i += 1  # increment i
```
Java & C
```c
i++; /* increment i */
i++; // increment i
```
---
## Code Blocks

Python
```python
if something:
    i = i + 1
else:
    i = i + 2
```
Java & C
```c
if (something) {
    i = i + 1;
} else {
    i = i + 2;
}
___
- In Python, code blocks are inferred from indentation

- In Java and C, code blocks are given by curly braces. 
Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is ignored.
---
## Type System

Python
```python
x = 1
y = 9.8
```
Java & C
```c
int x = 1;
float y = 9.8;
```
___
- In python, the type of an object is inferred by the interpreter at runtime.
This is called _dynamic_ typing.

- In Java and C, the data type is given before a variable name. Type compatibility
is checked at compile-time. This is called _static_ typing.
    - All names (types, variables, functions) must be _declared_ with a type 
    of known size before you use them
___
Python: sure
```python
i = 1
s = "foo"
s = i
```
Java & C: nope
```c
int i = 1;
char *s = "foo";
s = i;

# Philosophical Differences

## Memory Management

Python
```python
a_string = 'foobar'
another_string = a_string  # makes a copy
```
Java, using heap
```java
String a_string = "foobar";
String another_string = a_string; /* does not make a copy */
```
C, using stack memory
```c
char a_string[32];
strncpy(a_string, "foobar", 32);
char another_string[32];
strncpy(another_string, a_string, 32);  /* makes a copy */
```
___
- Python and Java manage memory using a _garbage collector_ which pauses program
execution periodically to free unused memory

- C programmers manage memory themselves, which is faster, but extremely error prone
___
## Strings

- Python: strings are objects containing Unicode characters, with an API 
provided by the Python runtime

- Java & C: strings are a sequence of characters, terminated by a '\0' (NULL character). 
Much more on this later.

## Execution Model

- Python & Java: source code -> bytecode -> virtual machine -> microprocessor

- C: source code -> machine code -> microprocessor

___
- The python interpreter and virtual machine are written in C

- The Java interpreter and virtual machine are written in C and C++

- Machine code (a.k.a. _binary_ or _object_ code) generated by an 
optimizing C compiler is very efficient
---
# Unique features of C
(and C-like languages)
---
## The Preprocessor

- C allows textual substitution of names in source code before compiling
the source code

- Preprocessor directives start with a pound/hash sign '#'
___
## Macros

A macro is like a global find/replace in a source file. Examples:
```c
#define FOO "foo"
#define MAX_STR 32
#define ADD(a,b) (a) + (b)

char str[MAX_STR];
strncpy(str, FOO, MAX_STR);
```
___
## Header files

A header (.h) file contains types, constants, and function declarations, 
grouped into a reusable file for modularity. Foo.h might contain:
```c
#define MAX_FOO 99

int do_foo(char *);  /* this declares the function do_foo() */
```

You can use `foo.h` in `foo.c` like this:
```c
#include "foo.h"

int i = do_foo("bar");
```
___
## System header files

In order to use functions defined in the C standard library, you need to
#include them like this:

```c
/* printf() is declared in stdio.h */
#include < stdio.h>

/* void means nothing, no return value */
void print_foo() {
    /* if we didn't include stdio.h this would not compile */
    printf("foo\n");
}
```

## Summary - Python

- The Python runtime environment hides a lot of complexity from programmers

- Python optimizes for programmer productivity over performance

- Modern processors are so fast that for small projects, it's a good tradeoff

---
## Summary - Java

- Java virtual machine makes it easier to write one code that runs on many platforms 

- Java benefits from static typing and encapsulation for safety, while still hiding a lot of complexity from programmers

---
## Summary - C

- C is relevant when performance is paramount, but provides much less help

- Motto: "No Hidden Mechanism"

- We will use C to get one step closer to understanding the machine
