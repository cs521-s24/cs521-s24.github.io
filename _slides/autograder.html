# Autograder

`grade` is a python script designed to build and test student projects
---
1. Clone the `autograder` repo into the home directory on a lab machine
    ```sh
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git@github.com:/phpeterson-usf/autograder
    ```
1. Put it on your `PATH` in `~/.bashrc`
    ```sh
    $ micro .bashrc
    ```
    Add to the bottom of `.bashrc`
    ```sh
    export PATH=~/autograder:$PATH
    ```
1. Run `.bashrc`
    ```sh
    $ source .bashrc
    ```
---
1. Clone the `tests` repo for our class onto your machine
    ```sh
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git@github.com:/cs521-s24/tests
    ```

2. New test cases will be added for each assignment so you will
    ```sh
    $ cd ~/tests
    $ git pull
    ```
    at least once per week
---
1. To use `grade`
    ```sh
    user@host:~/lab02-yourgithubid $ grade test -p lab02

    ```

2. If you fail a test case and want to see why
    ```sh
    user@host:~/lab02-yourgithubid $ grade test -v -p lab02
    ```
    -v (verbose) means print the expected input and expected vs. actual output for failing test cases. Actual vs. expected is printed in diff format.
---
1. `grade` has configuration options in `~/.config/grade/config.toml`
2. If you want to put `tests` somewhere besides `~` you can edit `config.toml`
    ```sh
    testspath = "~/cs521/tests"
    ```
3. More configuration options are available in the [README](https://github.com/phpeterson-usf/autograder/)
