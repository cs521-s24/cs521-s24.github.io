# Dynamic Memory Allocation

- how to allocate memory during run time, e.g. user input
- static memory allocation happens at compile time. e.g. int list[10]
- malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free()
---

# malloc()

- in <stdlib.h>
- allocates additional memory of numBytes from heap
```sh
malloc(numBytes)
```
- return type is a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory
- returns null if allocation fails
---

# variable declaration vs. allocation 

```sh
char* strm /* declares a pointer variable. content will be char */
char strs[10] /* declares and also allocates memory at compile time */
strm = malloc(10); /* allocates memory at run time */
```
---

# free()

- also in <stdlib.h>
- frees allocated memory = gives the control back to OS
- ptr = malloc() and free(ptr) work in pairs in the same scope
