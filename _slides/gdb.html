# GDB - GNU Project Debugger

--- 
# GDB

[GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) Project's open source debugger for C/C++ 

Common usage includes:

- set a breakpoint on a line in the code

- print a value of a variable or an expression

- follow the execution (run the next line)

- follow the function calls (step into a function)

# Demo

example [C file](https://github.com/cs221-s23/inclass/blob/main/week03/section01/gdb_demo.c) with a bug

# Using printf for debugging

- cannot inspect a variable/expression while running
- cannot follow the control flow (which if/else branch?)

# Useful command list (1)

- run or r –> executes the program from start to end. (with the command line arguments)
- break or b –> sets breakpoint on a particular line.
- next or n -> executes next line of code, but don’t dive into functions.
- step –> go to next instruction, diving into the function.
- print or p –> used to display the stored value.
- quit or q –> exits out of gdb.


---
# Useful command list (2)

- backtrace or bt -> prints the backtrace of the entire stack
- disable -> disable a breakpoint.
- enable –> enable a disabled breakpoint.
- clear –> to clear all breakpoints.
- continue –> continue normal execution.
- list or l –> displays the code. (default 10 lines)
